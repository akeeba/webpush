## What does it do?

This library allows you to implement [Web Push](https://web.dev/push-notifications-web-push-protocol/) in your Joomla extensions (compatible with Joomla 4.0 and later). You can use Web Push to easily send push notifications to the users of your component.

Possible use cases (not an exhaustive list):
* Forum or comment components, notifying users when they receive a reply or a post is made to a thread they chose to monitor.
* Automation components, when something interesting happens even when the user is not logged into the site.
* e-Commerce components, notifying the user on the progress of their order.

## How to use it

Check out the [documentation](docs/index.md). It's easy!
